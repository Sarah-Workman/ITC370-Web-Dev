    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have a few hobbies but I would like to talk about my current hobby that i'm working on. I started learning about canning and preserving food. The picture I included is my first try at making classic dill pickles. My goal is to grow lots of different varieties of canning pickles and gerkins from my garden next year. My next project is making jam, because we have rasberry and blackberry bushes that I want to use next year. </p>
